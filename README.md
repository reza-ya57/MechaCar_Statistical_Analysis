## Linear Regression to Predict MPG  
### AutosRUs is working on new protoype vehicle, the MechaCar. In this study we try to find the relationship of the varibles which are impact on fuel efficiency in new machine. Manager can use the result of this study to figure out how can improve the new prototype in order to have better fuel efficiency compare to other models. 
### we used multiple regression method to study on the variable relationship and predict the MPG of MechaCar prototypes.

-  Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Based on the above multiple regression resolt, we can say vehicle length and ground clearance as well as intercept have significant impact on MPG, or on the other hand these varible provided non-random amount of variance to the MPG values.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slop of this linear model not consider as zero value. By looking at p-value in regression model we can say the value is much smaller than significance level of 5% so there is sufficient evidence to reject null hypothesis.  

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
To answer to this question need to check the r-square value. According to this value (0.71) we can say this model can predict MPG of MechaCar prototypes efficiently.

A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:


Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
